# <div align="center">**Susceptibility optimization**</div>

This repository contains the code required to perform a minimization algorithm ....

# Usage instructions

The optimization relies on the computation of a Fieldmap, we use a Fourier based field estimation approach here: https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/susceptibility-to-fieldmap-fft.git
